warctika: Python library for reading and writing warc files, and processing
their contents through Apache Tika
============================================================================

This library was originally based upon the "warc" library by the Internet
Archive and others, but now relies upon the hanzo warctools. These can be
installed with 'pip install warctools'. Beware that there are several old
versions floating around under different names in the index.

WARC (Web ARChive) is a file format for storing web crawls.
